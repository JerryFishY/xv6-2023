1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?

usertrap() at kernel/trap.c

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)

p->trapframe->a7=0x7
$a7 is used to index into syscalls, and 0x7 is SYS_exec , resulting in a call to the system call implementation function sys_exec.

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?

SPP is 0, so it was in the user mode.

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?

lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
$a3

5. Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)

It access the memory region that is unused.
yes, the value of scause is 0xd, which means "Load page fault"

6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?

initcode\000\000\000\000\000\000\000
pid = 1
