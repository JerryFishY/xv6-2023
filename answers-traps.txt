1. Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?

$a0-$a7, other arguments will be stored to memory. $a2.

2. Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

It is actually " li a1,12 ", the compiler inlines the function for f(8)+1, and precompute its return calue 12.

3. At what address is the function printf located?

0x0642

4. What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?

0x38, jalr will store the address of the next address

5. What is the output? The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

HE110 World, it would be 0x00726c64

6. In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

printf will print the value of a2, since it is the printf expected where argument will be in.
